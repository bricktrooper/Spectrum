The esiest thing to do is operate the op amps using a bias at VDD/2.  Add the bias at the beginning and remove it at the end and between each stage too just like that design tha tyou found online

For the blocking cap, you don't need a massive cap,just use 0.1 uF and a big resistor like 10 K and you should be good.

The input amp from the example works, but idk why there is another blocking cap at the output considering we are now working with the virtual ground.
The point of the input amp is to use a non-inverting amp (potentially unity but depends on attentuation due to input loading from cap) the input and add a DC bias which is the virtual ground so idk.
We really only need another blocking cap at the output no?

You need to use resistors to separate logical voltage nodes, that's why summing node is separated from the inputs using a resistor

I more or less built the non-invering input amp and it produces the input waveform but shifted to exactly 2.5 V.  I really don't know why we need the interstage caps but maybe we do?  Something to investigate as we build this thing sequentially

The good thing is that I think a simple split rail power supply should be fine.  JUST DON'T DRIVE ANY LOADS USING THE VIRTUAL GROUND
